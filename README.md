# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview
This is a simple recipe website built as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The website will include a main index page with links to various recipe pages. This project is designed to help strengthen my HTML skills, focusing on creating the structure of the website, organizing content with appropriate tags, and practicing the fundamentals of HTML.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Creating a basic HTML structure with essential elements (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.)
- Using links (`<a>`) to navigate between pages
- Organizing content with headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) and paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Using lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) for recipe ingredients
- Embedding images using the `<img>` tag
- Creating a clean, easy-to-navigate website layout

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main page containing links to other recipe pages.
- **recipe1.html**, **recipe2.html**, etc.: Individual recipe pages that contain the details of each recipe.

## Reflection
By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to structure an HTML document, create links to navigate between pages, and organize content effectively. I will also learn how to write clean, semantic HTML to make the website easy to maintain and expand upon in future projects.

## Next Steps
Once this project is complete, I will revisit it later to enhance the design with CSS, and possibly add interactivity with JavaScript.
