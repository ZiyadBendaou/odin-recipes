        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple, fresh tomato soup that has been passed down through generations. It is especially good if you are using home-grown tomatoes that are very ripe.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
           <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
           <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
           <li>1 large slice of onion</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.</li>
            <li>Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium brown.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest.</li>
            <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
